# Members Only

This is a Ruby On Rails project part of The Odin Projects curriculum. 

The purpose of this project was to create a website that allows registered users to create posts and view the names of members' posts, while preventing non-registered users from posting or seeing who created a post.

This project helped solidify my understanding of:

- Creating models with associations to each other.
- Modifying databases using migrations.
- Using the Devise framework as an authentication library.
- Using bootstrap to create a navigation partial.
- Creating and modifying Rails' views to show specific data using ERB.

Future development would involve cleaning up the front-end to be more presentable and pleasent for the user experience.
